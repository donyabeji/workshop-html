  <h1>Resume of Ronaldo</h1>
  <p>In April 2017, it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police Department for an allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009.[580][581] Documents, confirmed by Ronaldo's lawyers, state that Ronaldo paid a woman US$375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement.[580][582] Ronaldo and his lawyers issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations, describing them as an "intentional defamation campaign" with parts significantly "altered and/or completely fabricated",[583][584] a claim which Der Spiegel categorically denied.[585] In July 2019, Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo over allegations of rape; the statement added: "Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt."[586] The same woman, in September 2018, filed a civil lawsuit in Nevada accusing Ronaldo of rape.

<h1>Contact Ronaldo</h1>
<p>Manchester United do not want to give Cristiano Ronaldo a pay-off to leave and given the will of both player
   and club to part ways, it is hoped a resolution can be reached soon; it is now clear there is "close to zero
    chance" Ronaldo will play for the club again</p><form action="/action_page.php">
